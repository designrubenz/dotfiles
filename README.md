# My dotfiles

All my dotfiles are symlinked from my home directory to the folder of this repository:
eg. `ln -s dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc .zshrc` links the zsh-configuration with my dotfiles-folder.

I use zsh, [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) and the [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) theme/prompt.
